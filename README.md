# üåê RF Outdoor Link Planner

A **web-based RF (Radio Frequency) link planning tool** built using **React** and **Leaflet.js** that allows users to visualize, configure, and analyze point-to-point wireless communication links on a map.  
It demonstrates **geometric computation, user interactivity, data visualization**, and **API integration** ‚Äî all in a single cohesive frontend project.

## üß≠ What is this project?

The **RF Link Planner** is an **interactive tool** for visualizing communication links between towers and analyzing their **Fresnel zone** ‚Äî the region around a line-of-sight radio path that affects signal strength and interference.

Users can:
- Click on a map to **place towers**
- Configure each tower‚Äôs **frequency (in GHz)**
- Connect towers of matching frequencies with **links**
- View **link distance and frequency** on hover
- Visualize the **First Fresnel Zone** as a red ellipse
- Edit or remove towers and links dynamically

This project simplifies the **core logic used in RF network planning tools** like Ubiquiti AirLink, Cambium LINKPlanner, or Ekahau ‚Äî in a compact, easy-to-use frontend implementation.

## üí° Why I Built This

In telecommunications, **RF link planning** is essential for ensuring **clear line-of-sight** between base stations or towers.  
But most existing professional tools are complex and locked behind enterprise software.

This project was built to:
1. Demonstrate **geospatial UI design** and **geometry-based computation** in React.
2. Showcase integration of **real-world physics** (RF propagation) into a frontend system.
3. Highlight skills in **React state management, event-driven architecture, Leaflet mapping**, and **API usage**.
4. Provide a **proof-of-concept educational tool** to visualize how frequencies, distance, and terrain elevation affect wireless link quality.

## üß© How It Works

### üó∫Ô∏è Map Interaction
- Built with **Leaflet.js**, an open-source mapping library.
- Users can click anywhere to add towers.
- Each tower stores coordinates (`lat`, `lng`) and frequency (`GHz`).

### üîó Link Creation Logic
- When two towers of the **same frequency** are selected, a link (green line) is drawn between them.
- Each link object stores:

First Fresnel zone radius:
r = sqrt( (Œª * d1 * d2) / (d1 + d2) )

Where:
  ‚Ä¢ r  = radius of the first Fresnel zone at a point (meters)
  ‚Ä¢ Œª  = wavelength of the signal (meters). Œª = c / f
  ‚Ä¢ d1 = distance from the transmitter to the point (meters)
  ‚Ä¢ d2 = distance from the receiver to the point (meters)

Constants / units:
  ‚Ä¢ c = speed of light = 3 √ó 10^8 m/s
  ‚Ä¢ f = frequency in Hz (if you accept MHz/GHz in UI, convert: 1 MHz = 1e6 Hz, 1 GHz = 1e9 Hz)
      Example: 5 GHz = 5e9 Hz ‚Üí Œª = 3e8 / 5e9 = 0.06 m
‚Äã	
The app fetches terrain elevation data from the Open-Elevation API for the midpoint to provide more realistic visualization.
The zone is drawn as a 2D red ellipse centered on the link midpoint.
Data Flow
User clicks map ‚Üí tower created
User selects 2 towers ‚Üí link created if frequencies match
User clicks link ‚Üí ellipse visualized
User edits tower frequency ‚Üí invalid links auto-remove
User removes tower or link ‚Üí updates state, removes map objects
All state is handled in React using:
useState for towers, links, fresnel zones, selected tower
useEffect for ellipse rendering with Leaflet overlays
